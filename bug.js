In React Router Dom v6, using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that's conditionally rendered can lead to unexpected behavior. If the component containing `useNavigate` isn't mounted when the component tree renders initially, `useNavigate` will return `null`, resulting in errors when trying to navigate.  This is because the hook's internal state isn't properly initialized until the component mounts. Consider this example:

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [showButton, setShowButton] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation that sets showButton to true
    setTimeout(() => setShowButton(true), 1000);
  }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    // navigate('/some-route'); // This will fail if showButton is false
    if (navigate) {
      navigate('/some-route');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {showButton && (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Navigate</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The navigation will fail if the button is clicked before the `setTimeout` completes and `showButton` becomes `true`. This is a subtle bug because the error isn't always immediately obvious.
